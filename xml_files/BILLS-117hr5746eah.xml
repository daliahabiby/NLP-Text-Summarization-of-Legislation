Congress finds that its authority and responsibility to enforce the Guarantee Clause is clear given that Federal courts have not enforced this clause because they understood that its enforcement is committed to Congress by the Constitution.</text></paragraph>

Research shows that communities of color are more likely to face nearly every barrier to voting than their white counterparts.</text></subparagraph> <subparagraph id="HB45D6D4997D3456B88DC0B59CE3B6C9F" indent="up1"><enum>(D)</enum><text>Congress finds that racial disparities in disenfranchisement due to past felony convictions is particularly stark. In 2020, according to the Sentencing Project, an estimated 5,200,000 Americans could not vote due to a felony conviction. One in 16 African Americans of voting age is disenfranchised, a rate 3.7 times greater than that of non-African Americans. In seven States—Alabama, Florida, Kentucky, Mississippi, Tennessee, Virginia, and Wyoming—more than one in seven African Americans is disenfranchised, twice the national average for African Americans. Congress finds that felony disenfranchisement was one of the tools of intentional racial discrimination during the Jim Crow era. Congress further finds that current racial disparities in felony disenfranchisement are linked to this history of voter suppression, structural racism in the criminal justice system, and ongoing effects of historical discrimination.</text></subparagraph></paragraph>

Two States (Maine and Vermont) and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico do not disenfranchise individuals with criminal convictions at all. In 2020, the District of Columbia re-enfranchised its citizens who are under the supervision of the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Twenty-eight states disenfranchise certain individuals on felony probation or parole. In 11 States, a conviction for certain offenses can result in lifetime disenfranchisement. </text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H2F27FEF85FC4422882219BD7A93E67B1"><enum>(6)</enum><text>Several States deny the right to vote to individuals convicted of certain misdemeanors.</text></paragraph>
<paragraph id="HA67AB7184398480BBB5EF56982F33688"><enum>(7)</enum><text>In 2020, an estimated 5,200,000 citizens of the United States, or about 1 in 44 adults in the United States, could not vote as a result of a felony conviction. Of the 5,200,000 citizens barred from voting then, only 24 percent were in prison. By contrast, 75 percent of persons disenfranchised then resided in their communities while on probation or parole or after having completed their sentences. Approximately 2,200,000 citizens who had completed their sentences were disenfranchised due to restrictive State laws. As of November 2018, the lifetime ban for persons with certain felony convictions was eliminated through a Florida ballot initiative. As a result, as many as 1,400,000 people are now eligible to have their voting rights restored. In 4 States—Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, and Tennessee—more than 7 percent of the total population is disenfranchised.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H2F6BEBC9D85F42C1A8D78BB5F3702212"><enum>(8)</enum><text>In those States that disenfranchise individuals post-sentence, the right to vote can be regained in theory, but in practice this possibility is often granted in a non-uniform and potentially discriminatory manner. Disenfranchised individuals sometimes must either obtain a pardon or an order from the Governor or an action by the parole or pardon board, depending on the offense and State. Individuals convicted of a Federal offense often have additional barriers to regaining voting rights.</text></paragraph>
<paragraph id="HBF8DD75B87BA4633BB26CB2A7BEEDD6E"><enum>(9)</enum><text>Many felony disenfranchisement laws today derive directly from post-Civil War efforts to stifle the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. Between 1865 and 1880, at least 14 states—Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas—enacted or expanded their felony disenfranchisement laws. One of the primary goals of these laws was to prevent African Americans from voting. Of the states that enacted or expanded their felony disenfranchisement laws during this post-Civil War period, at least 11 continue to preclude persons on felony probation or parole from voting. </text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HC58B9D8D643C4228B62AD4D012F38FF0"><enum>(10)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">State disenfranchisement laws disproportionately impact racial and ethnic minorities. In recent years, African Americans have been imprisoned at over 5 times the rate of Whites. More than 6 percent of the voting-age African-American population, or 1,800,000 African Americans, are disenfranchised due to a felony conviction. In 9 States—Alabama (16 percent), Arizona (13 percent), Florida (15 percent), Kentucky (15 percent), Mississippi (16 percent), South Dakota (14 percent), Tennessee (21 percent), Virginia (16 percent), and Wyoming (36 percent)—more than 1 in 8 African Americans are unable to vote because of a felony conviction, twice the national average for African Americans. </text></paragraph>
<paragraph id="H40A17AA75501484BBA0233C2DF2820B4"><enum>(11)</enum><text>Latino citizens are also disproportionately disenfranchised based upon their disproportionate representation in the criminal justice system. In recent years, Latinos have been imprisoned at 2.5 times the rate of Whites. More than 2 percent of the voting-age Latino population, or 560,000 Latinos, are disenfranchised due to a felony conviction. In 34 states Latinos are disenfranchised at a higher rate than the general population. In 11 states 4 percent or more of Latino adults are disenfranchised due to a felony conviction (Alabama, 4 percent; Arizona, 7 percent; Arkansas, 4 percent; Idaho, 4 percent; Iowa, 4 percent; Kentucky, 6 percent; Minnesota, 4 percent; Mississippi, 5 percent; Nebraska, 6 percent; Tennessee, 11 percent; Wyoming, 4 percent), twice the national average for Latinos. </text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HC333F4FC92124FC9A7FD93AAE1C1E1B6"><enum>(12)</enum><text>Disenfranchising citizens who have been convicted of a criminal offense and who are living and working in the community serves no compelling State interest and hinders their rehabilitation and reintegration into society.</text></paragraph>
<paragraph id="H17C4490E3E284155A592FEFF46F8016B"><enum>(13)</enum><text>State disenfranchisement laws can suppress electoral participation among eligible voters by discouraging voting among family and community members of disenfranchised persons. Future electoral participation by the children of disenfranchised parents may be impacted as well. Models of successful re-entry for persons convicted of a crime emphasize the importance of community ties, feeling vested and integrated, and prosocial attitudes. Individuals with criminal convictions who succeed in avoiding recidivism are typically more likely to see themselves as law-abiding members of the community. Restoration of voting rights builds those qualities and facilitates reintegration into the community. That is why allowing citizens with criminal convictions who are living in a community to vote is correlated with a lower likelihood of recidivism. Restoration of voting rights thus reduces violence and protects public safety. </text></paragraph> <paragraph commented="no" display-inline="no-display-inline" id="H13C51299A80D41FDBD80FEE0D33FCFDF"><enum>(14)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The United States is one of the only Western democracies that permits the permanent denial of voting rights for individuals with felony convictions.</text></paragraph>
<paragraph id="H966451871552420096FDB9620478A835"><enum>(15)</enum><text>The Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishments <quote>guarantees individuals the right not to be subjected to excessive sanctions.</quote> (<italic>Roper</italic> v. <italic>Simmons</italic>, 543 U.S. 551, 560 (2005)).

As the Supreme Court has long recognized, <quote>[t]he concept of proportionality is central to the Eighth Amendment.</quote> (<italic>Graham</italic> v. <italic>Florida</italic>, 560 U.S. 48, 59 (2010)). Many State disenfranchisement laws are grossly disproportional to the offenses that lead to disenfranchisement and thus violate the bar on cruel and unusual punishments. For example, a number of states mandate lifetime disenfranchisement for a single felony conviction or just two felony convictions, even where the convictions were for non-violent offenses. In numerous other States, disenfranchisement can last years or even decades while individuals remain on probation or parole, often only because a person cannot pay their legal financial obligations. These kinds of extreme voting bans run afoul of the Eighth Amendment.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H3B02822DBE64499FB4D22BDE677D4764"><enum>(16)</enum><text>The Twenty-Fourth Amendment provides that the right to vote <quote>shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any State by reason of failure to pay any poll tax or other tax.</quote>. Section 2 of the Twenty-Fourth Amendment gives Congress the power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation. Court fines and fees that individuals must pay to have their voting rights restored constitute an <quote>other tax</quote> for purposes of the Twenty-Fourth Amendment. At least five States explicitly require the payment of fines and fees before individuals with felony convictions can have their voting rights restored. More than 20 other states effectively tie the right to vote to the payment of fines and fees, by requiring that individuals complete their probation or parole before their rights are restored. In these States, the non-payment of fines and fees is a basis on which probation or parole can be extended. Moreover, these states sometimes do not record the basis on which an individual’s probation or parole was extended, making it impossible to determine from the State’s records whether non-payment of fines and fees is the reason that an individual remains on probation or parole. For these reasons, the only way to ensure that States do not deny the right to vote based solely on non-payment of fines and fees is to prevent States from conditioning voting rights on the completion of probation or parole. </text></paragraph></section>

As made clear at the Constitutional Convention and the State ratification debates that followed, this grant of congressional authority was meant to “insure free and fair elections,” promote the uniform administration of Federal elections, and “preserve and restore to the people their equal and sacred rights of election.”.</text></paragraph>

As the Supreme Court has recognized, the Elections Clause empowers Congress to “protect the elections on which its existence depends,” <italic>Ex parte Yarbrough</italic>, 110 U.S. 651, 658 (1884), and “protect the citizen in the exercise of rights conferred by the Constitution of the United States essential to the healthy organization of the government itself,” <italic>id</italic>. at 666.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HB1B134F01317457AB7CE5372F59ECAC8"><enum>(4)</enum><text>The Elections Clause grants Congress “plenary and paramount jurisdiction over the whole subject” of Federal elections, <italic>Ex parte Siebold</italic>, 100 U.S. 371, 388 (1879), allowing Congress to implement “a complete code for congressional elections.” <italic>Smiley v.

To further these substantial interests, campaign finance disclosure must be timely and complete, and must disclose the true and original source of money given, transferred, and spent to influence Federal elections.

<paragraph id="H1F8A8C489D9C48F6B2F73C814CC50B9A"><enum>(6)</enum><text>Paid advertising on large online platforms is different from advertising placed on other common media in terms of the comparatively low cost of reaching large numbers of people, the availability of sophisticated microtargeting, and the ease with which online advertisers, particularly those located outside the United States, can evade disclosure requirements. Requiring large online platforms to maintain public files of information about the online political ads they disseminate is the best and least restrictive means to ensure the voting public has complete information about who is trying to influence their votes and to aid enforcement of other laws, including the prohibition on foreign money in domestic campaigns. </text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HB6D342278FB64FF597BE976CFE9F0761"><enum>(7)</enum><text>The reach of a few large internet platforms—larger than any broadcast, satellite, or cable provider—has greatly facilitated the scope and effectiveness of disinformation campaigns. For instance, the largest platform has over 210,000,000 American users—over 160,000,000 of them on a daily basis. By contrast, the largest cable television provider has 22,430,000 subscribers, while the largest satellite television provider has 21,000,000 subscribers.

<paragraph id="H4B81FA6D7794401EB520CC95C527FE59"><enum>(8)</enum><text>The public nature of broadcast television, radio, and satellite ensures a level of publicity for any political advertisement. These communications are accessible to the press, fact-checkers, and political opponents. This creates strong disincentives for a candidate to disseminate materially false, inflammatory, or contradictory messages to the public. Social media platforms, in contrast, can target portions of the electorate with direct, ephemeral advertisements often on the basis of private information the platform has on individuals, enabling political advertisements that are contradictory, racially or socially inflammatory, or materially false.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HC8B715191C794C4EA51D72AA7AECBFE8"><enum>(9)</enum><text>According to comscore, 2 companies own 8 of the 10 most popular smart phone applications as of June 2017, including the most popular social media and email services which deliver information and news to users without requiring proactivity by the user.

Today, however, because the clear majority of the information on social media sites is uncurated and there is a rapid proliferation of information sources and other sites that can reinforce information, there is an increasing likelihood that the information available to average consumers may be inaccurate (whether intentionally or otherwise) and may be more easily manipulable than in prior eras.</quote>.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HEFBBF94D892D4F6BA76A4497AEC53A75"><enum>(13)</enum><text>On November 24, 2016, The Washington Post reported findings from 2 teams of independent researchers that concluded Russians <quote>exploited American-made technology platforms to attack U.S. democracy at a particularly vulnerable moment *** as part of a broadly effective strategy of sowing distrust in U.S. democracy and its leaders.</quote>. </text></paragraph>

While the law seems neutral, its actual effect is to privilege the independently wealthy who want to run, because given the demands of running for office, candidates who must work to pay for childcare or to afford health insurance are effectively being left out of the process, even if they have sufficient support to mount a viable campaign.</text></paragraph>
<paragraph id="H68F45F993D674B9788896CB580AEDE46"><enum>(3)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Thus current practice favors those prospective candidates who do not need to rely on a regular paycheck to make ends meet. The consequence is that everyday Americans who have firsthand knowledge of the importance of stable childcare, a safety net, or great public schools are less likely to get a seat at the table. This governance by the few is antithetical to the democratic experiment, but most importantly, when lawmakers do not share the concerns of everyday Americans, their policies reflect that.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H0509B68F7E924A278ABD0C6631C95DFB"><enum>(4)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">These circumstances have contributed to a Congress that does not always reflect everyday Americans. The New York Times reported in 2019 that fewer than 5 percent of representatives cite blue-collar or service jobs in their biographies. A 2015 survey by the Center for Responsive Politics showed that the median net worth of lawmakers was just over $1 million in 2013, or 18 times the wealth of the typical American household.</text></paragraph>

For instance, women are 51 percent of the American population. Yet even with a record number of women serving in the One Hundred Sixteenth Congress, the Pew Research Center notes that more than three out of four Members of this Congress are male. The Center for American Women And Politics found that one third of women legislators surveyed had been actively discouraged from running for office, often by political professionals. This type of discouragement, combined with the prohibitions on using campaign funds for domestic needs like childcare, burdens that still fall disproportionately on American women, particularly disadvantages working mothers. These barriers may explain why only 10 women in history have given birth while serving in Congress, in spite of the prevalence of working parents in other professions. Yet working mothers and fathers are best positioned to create policy that reflects the lived experience of most Americans.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HCCB6F24DE676446E9D4985203E3A6576"><enum>(6)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Working mothers, those caring for their elderly parents, and young professionals who rely on their jobs for health insurance should have the freedom to run to serve the people of the United States.
