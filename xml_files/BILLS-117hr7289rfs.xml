There are more than 5,000 types of registered PFAS compounds. This chemical class is not currently regulated at the Federal level.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H361C1C14D2044FAE96269B6126F5A70E"><enum>(2)</enum><text>PFAS have been detected in air, water, soil, food, biosolids, and more. They can accumulate and remain in the body for a long time, and potentially lead to serious health effects including cancer, low infant birthweight, liver and kidney issues, reproductive and developmental problems, and more.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H6BC26E8E19594BD78D4A9C157A0AA8AA"><enum>(3)</enum><text>There remains much unknown about PFAS toxicity, human and environmental health effects, exposure pathways, as well as effective removal, treatment, and destruction methods, and safe alternatives to PFAS.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HA474ACEFAE144AB5995DD5611F70B07A"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Federal research efforts have been fragmented at various agencies and struggled to effectively address the full scope of challenges presented by PFAS.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H592C135A039C4AA2ADAE0DCC68345F19"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Regulatory action and cleanup depend on scientific analysis of toxicity data, decision making on how best to deal with PFAS, and understanding the significance of the many exposure pathways that exist.
