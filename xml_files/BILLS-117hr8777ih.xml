<paragraph id="H92AE5E98D25649DFB1F6134B9CB26D5E"><enum>(1)</enum><text>the illegality of consciously parallel pricing coordination under sections 1 and 3(a) of the Sherman Act (<external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/15/1">15 U.S.C. 1</external-xref>, 3(a)); and</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HE4D1EE256AD644E5B6F453A14151C94A"><enum>(2)</enum><text>the concerted-action requirement for claimed violations of section 1 or 3(a) of the Sherman Act.</text></paragraph></section>

<subsection id="HBF5D3B2CB0D440B69E53915C9E753E64"><enum>(a)</enum><header>Consciously parallel pricing coordination</header> 
<paragraph id="H881DD19120EE48DE9251C4739C109398"><enum>(1)</enum><text>The American economy is built on the foundations of open markets and fair competition. These core principles of economic freedom are what stimulate innovation, improve the quality of products and services, and ensure that prices are competitive.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HFD2079CE574E4F53995B1CB7D75CD722"><enum>(2)</enum><text>The antitrust laws are designed to ensure American consumers and businesses are afforded the benefits of competition throughout the economy. The supreme evil of antitrust law is, accordingly, collusion among market rivals. Such collusion undermines competitive markets, stifles innovation, and results in degraded quality and prices that are dictated by competitors’ agreement rather than competitors’ rivalry.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H845F7A98028C44679097CC0A794B34B1"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Sections 1 and 3(a) of the Sherman Act (<external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/15/1">15 U.S.C. 1</external-xref>, 3(a)) categorically prohibit—as the most pernicious types of contracts, combinations in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracies, in restraint of trade or commerce—naked agreements among actual or potential competitors to fix prices, rig bids, or allocate markets. An agreement to fix the quantity of products or services bought or sold is a form of agreement to fix prices. These agreements are per se unlawful.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H8F6BE870C3724A88B5E43A227FA508FD"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Courts have been unduly hostile to claims of price fixing that are based on tacit agreement among competitors. They have, at times, declined to recognize tacit agreement as a contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy; they have held that allegations or evidence, taken as a whole, that are as consistent with <quote>conscious parallelism</quote> as with agreement are generally insufficient to survive a motion to dismiss or motion for summary judgment; and they have concluded a claimant must offer allegations or evidence tending to exclude the possibility of independent action. See, e.g., Brooke Grp. Ltd. v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., 509 U.S. 209, 227 (1993); Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, 588 (1986); Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Serv. Corp., 465 U.S. 752, 764 (1984).</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H5264EB7CE33A4445AE46274CE226D19E"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Section 4 of this Act rejects the judicial decisions that have prevented meritorious price-fixing cases from advancing to trial and judgment. It does so by providing that, in civil actions, consciously parallel pricing coordination—as defined by this Act—is a <quote>contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce</quote> under sections 1 and 3(a) of the Sherman Act.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H484CD95618CC4DBC986319619248E570"><enum>(6)</enum><text>Section 4 of this Act does not supersede the law governing price fixing. It instead supplements and complements that law. It does not apply to criminal prosecutions.</text></paragraph></subsection> 
<subsection id="HF9C1FD7D78D549BFAD5C73109222D47B"><enum>(b)</enum><header>Concerted action</header> 
<paragraph id="H672A7C007B074D2AB1961784BCDBBA4F"><enum>(1)</enum><text>The words <quote>contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy</quote> in sections 1 and 3(a) of the Sherman Act require some form of agreement between two or more persons, but that agreement need not be expressly made. A tacit agreement also qualifies. Accordingly, the words <quote>contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy</quote> encompass both express and tacit agreements.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H9124ECE25A504532B65C8F0D02010264"><enum>(2)</enum><text>Although consciously parallel behavior alone does not constitute a contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy under sections 1 and 3(a) of the Sherman Act, consciously parallel behavior can be evidence of an agreement. And once the consciously parallel behavior crosses the line into consciously parallel coordination, the behavior qualifies as tacit agreement—that is, a contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H31163AE959214F9697D9A712810BEB9C"><enum>(3)</enum><text>In Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 548–49, 553–57, 564–70 (2007), the Supreme Court held that a complaint alleging that competitors engaged in parallel, anticompetitive conduct did not do enough to exclude the possibility that the competitors engaged in independent action and therefore failed to plausibly plead the existence of a conspiracy under section 1 of the Sherman Act. In so holding, the Court understated the significance of consciously parallel behavior as evidence of agreement and left little or no room for tacit agreements in the meaning of <quote>contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy</quote>.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HEEBDC2C99FB24886B45B62777BAC305E"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Section 5 of this Act rejects the Twombly Court’s cramped reading of the Sherman Act’s language, clarifies that the words <quote>contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy</quote> encompass tacit agreements, and specifies the standards for pleading and proving a contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy under sections 1 and 3(a) of the Sherman Act.</text></paragraph></subsection></section>
