Slower speeds needlessly occupy busy amateur frequencies for longer than necessary to transmit messages, leading to unnecessary crowding without benefit to anyone, and a delay in the transmission of mission critical information during emergencies and declared disasters.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H08DBF7C16FC24ADC9D7A9388D9D84DBD"><enum>(6)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">United States amateurs developed the first amateur digital protocols, but now are consigned to watching as amateurs in other countries take the lead in squeezing more data within each bandwidth. Amateurs in other countries universally are permitted to use modern digital data speeds denied amateurs in the United States. United States amateurs can hear and decode higher speed signals every day, but are not permitted to respond with the same protocol.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H50F0A28B7C7A41DCA8B19356A3C5E1C2"><enum>(7)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">This situation is not because of any affirmative decision, but simply because there has been an 8-year unexplained lack of action to update the rules.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H7D6EE04218344D4DBF4500B215B9F816"><enum>(8)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">It is embarrassing that in recent years, including this year, radio amateurs have had to apply to the Commission for temporary waivers, which are always granted, of the limit on data communications to efficiently manage emergency, health, and welfare messages from hurricane-prone Caribbean islands, and even from within the United States. Amateurs in the Caribbean, as in other areas of the world, generally are using equipment and software developed by the amateur community and promoted by the International Telecommunication Union specifically to ensure communications capabilities during times of severe weather.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HBE105D778EC44007A1A2DA95DEED6CA7"><enum>(9)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Amateur radio has led many young people into scientific and engineering professions, including many related to the digital services and technologies that are at the heart of the wireless communications marketplace of today. The incentive to work on improving data communications technologies is the ability to experiment on the airwaves and to employ improved capabilities both casually and in times of need.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H5AF33956FC8F4FAF838BBDB5943C8BC6"><enum>(10)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">This capability should be restored to radio amateurs in the United States.</text></paragraph></section><section id="H9F1447CF502D464F967D56E934EFA9BF"><enum>3.</enum><header>Repeal of symbol rate limits for transmissions on certain amateur frequencies and adoption of 2.8 kHz bandwidth limit</header><text display-inline="no-display-inline">Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Federal Communications Commission, pursuant to section 303 of the Communications Act of 1934 (<external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/47/303">47 U.S.C. 303</external-xref>) and as proposed in FCC Docket 16–239, shall—</text><paragraph id="H677A17E774D4455D9D5EEA2D393A4269"><enum>(1)</enum><text>repeal the symbol (or baud) rate limits in part 97.307(f) of title 47, Code of Federal Regulations; and</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HC0EF634AC4834556BC0B919594D13C83"><enum>(2)</enum><text>adopt, in place of such symbol (or baud) rate limits, a 2.8 kHz bandwidth limit for any single digital signal on the frequencies referred to in such part.</text></paragraph></section><section id="HBC0C7858898D4B5991A55B378F16E2B1"><enum>4.</enum><header>Commission defined</header><text display-inline="no-display-inline">In this Act, the term <quote>Commission</quote> means the Federal Communications Commission.</text></section></legis-body></bill>
