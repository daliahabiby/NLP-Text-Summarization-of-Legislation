In addition, Federal courts have adopted local rules governing the conduct of attorneys appearing before them. As a result, State and Federal courts have extensive authority and tools to address attorney misconduct that occurs during the course of litigation before them, including monetary sanctions, striking offending pleadings or other papers, or referring the matter to disciplinary authorities, which could lead to a reprimand, censure, license suspension, disbarment, or other available disciplinary sanctions.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H60EF9CF5C4D040489E204066A0F64FE3"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Consistent with the longstanding principle of judicial regulation and oversight of attorneys and the legal profession, numerous Federal agencies have included broad practice of law exclusions in major rules, including the Federal Trade Commission’s <quote>Mortgage Assistance Relief Services</quote> Rule issued in November 2010 and the Department of Housing and Urban Development’s <quote>Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act</quote> Rule issued in June 2011.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H022CC9C74EFE4D05B6C8CD639255FB1F"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Also consistent with the principle of judicial regulation of attorneys and the legal profession, Congress has generally declined to enact legislation regulating the practice of law, including litigation activities of attorneys.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HA20FBF208F8B43A791F2B42637FD855B"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Congress has also incorporated broad practice of law exclusions into certain Federal statutes. For example, section 1027(e) of the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 excludes most attorneys engaged in the practice of law from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s regulatory and enforcement authority, while the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act of 1977 originally contained a complete exemption for attorneys engaged in the practice of law.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HE00DC92303AC493780736962E79F39AB"><enum>(6)</enum><text>Although Congress removed the complete attorney exemption from the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act in 1986 based in part on its belief that the revised Act would only apply to attorneys’ non-litigation collection activities and that State courts would continue to regulate attorneys’ litigation activities, the United States Supreme Court held in Heintz v. Jenkins, 514 U.S. 291 (1995), that attorneys could be subject to the Act even when they are engaged in litigation activities. As a result, many attorneys now are routinely sued for litigation activities in State court that are alleged to be technical violations of the Act, even when consumers suffer no harm.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H8B3B145BB3314EAFB4A064657CDB0392"><enum>(7)</enum><text>In each of its annual reports to Congress on the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act from 1998 through 2006, the Federal Trade Commission formally recommended that Congress reexamine and amend the definition of <quote>debt collector</quote> in the Act to exempt <quote>attorneys who pursue debtors solely through litigation (or similar <quote>legal</quote> practices).</quote></text></paragraph><paragraph id="H4DF7495046B74263919692CB269C2430"><enum>(8)</enum><text>In recent years, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has also aggressively sought to regulate attorneys’ collection activities, including their litigation activities, despite the broad practice of law exclusion in section 1027(e) of the Consumer Financial Protection Act. The Bureau’s aggressive actions could also lead to other Federal agencies adopting rules or practices regulating attorneys’ litigation activities in other types of court cases.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H63D4F0F059CC4553A85D003C81A0C054"><enum>(9)</enum><text>These developments have undermined State and Federal courts’ primary and inherent authority to regulate and oversee attorneys engaged in the practice of law by creating multiple conflicting sets of rules and standards for attorneys, resulting in unfair lawsuits against attorneys pursuing valid legal claims for clients in court, increased attorney malpractice insurance rates, difficulty in obtaining legal representation, and reduced access to justice.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H91BCEB3ADA7B456BA3D66C6DEF9EEAA1"><enum>(10)</enum><text>On January 26, 2011, the Conference of Chief Justices adopted Resolution 1 (<quote>In Support of Preserving Traditional State Court Regulation of Lawyers and Opposing Expanded Federal Agency Regulation of Lawyers and the Practice of Law</quote>), affirming that primary regulation and oversight of attorneys and the legal profession should continue to be vested in the State courts, not Federal agencies or Congress, and that the courts are in the best position to fulfill that important function. The Resolution also expressed support for Congress and Federal agencies’ decisions to include broad practice of law exclusions in certain Federal statutes and agency rules, and opposition to Federal legislation or rules intended to establish or expand the Federal regulatory jurisdiction of attorneys engaged in the practice of law.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H9A8B3189BE0F47E0A4A03FB0E238DB72"><enum>(11)</enum><text>While the activities constituting the practice of law are determined by the State in which an attorney is licensed or admitted to practice, litigation activities in connection with a legal action in State or Federal court are considered to be part of the practice of law in every State.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H49B555D890524C74A2992604AE6E4FCA"><enum>(12)</enum><text>To protect and restore State and Federal courts’ primary and inherent authority to regulate and oversee attorneys and the legal profession, Federal legislation is needed to clarify that—</text><subparagraph id="H43C0446B05604ADAABD5F8C4C55462EA"><enum>(A)</enum><text>attorneys engaged in litigation should be regulated and disciplined exclusively by State supreme courts, their attorney disciplinary agencies, and other State and Federal courts of competent jurisdiction;</text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="HE2E9E5DD9CFA4E6992BE438E8E54AE2E"><enum>(B)</enum><text>Federal agencies shall have no regulatory authority over litigation activities of attorneys;
