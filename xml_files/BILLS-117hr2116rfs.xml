As of February 2021, the U.S. Army removed minimum hair length requirements and lifted restrictions on any soldier wearing braids, twists, locs, and cornrows in order to promote inclusivity and accommodate the hair needs of soldiers.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HFAD263D5823A4BE0B2985A4465D13C1A"><enum>(8)</enum><text>As a type of racial or national origin discrimination, discrimination on the basis of natural or protective hairstyles that people of African descent are commonly adorned with violates existing Federal law, including provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (<external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/42/2000e">42 U.S.C. 2000e et seq.</external-xref>), section 1977 of the Revised Statutes (<external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/42/1981">42 U.S.C. 1981</external-xref>), and the Fair Housing Act (<external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/42/3601">42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq.</external-xref>). However, some Federal courts have misinterpreted Federal civil rights law by narrowly interpreting the meaning of race or national origin, and thereby permitting, for example, employers to discriminate against people of African descent who wear natural or protective hairstyles even though the employment policies involved are not related to workers’ ability to perform their jobs.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H2ABF1F44EF0B44C6969F7D3A4D4E5B2C"><enum>(9)</enum><text>Applying this narrow interpretation of race or national origin has resulted in a lack of Federal civil
