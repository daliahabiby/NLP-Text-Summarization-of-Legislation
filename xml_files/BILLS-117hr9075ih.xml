Human rights activists and international media organizations reported cases of political prisoners confined with persons accused of and convicted of violent crime. The Islamic Republic of Iran also often exiled political prisoners to prisons in remote provinces far from the families of such prisoners as a means of reprisal, denied such prisoners a right to correspondence and access to legal counsel, and held such prisoners in solitary confinement for long periods. </text></paragraph><paragraph id="HA7E30440BE8D4988ACDF5B4FC692A556"><enum>(9)</enum><text>According to the organization Iran Human Rights, in October of 2021, political prisoners Shapour Ehsanirad, Pouya Ghobadi, Esmail Gerami, Akbar Bagheri, and Akbar Shirazi were seriously injured after being attacked by prisoners accused of or convicted of violent crime. </text></paragraph><paragraph id="HDF2B0A6B3EC94269A4239333E9CF3928"><enum>(10)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">According to the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Ministry of Intelligence of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the Intelligence Organization of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps control secret detention centers with <quote>deplorable</quote> conditions. Such centers often house, for extended pretrial detentions, political prisoners and other persons arbitrarily arrested on national security charges. For example, Ali Younesi and Amirhossein Moradi have been arbitrarily detained in section 209 of Evin Prison since such persons were arrested in April of 2020. Evin Prison, a notorious facility located in Tehran, is under the control of the Ministry of Intelligence of the Islamic Republic of Iran and is a primary prison for political detainees.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H1533DCFF2A0A4699B023F2691DA12E4C"><enum>(11)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Attorneys who defend political prisoners detained by the Islamic Republic of Iran are regularly arrested, detained, and subjected to excessive punishments for engaging in regular professional activities.
