The PRC describes BRI as a straightforward and wholly beneficial plan for all countries. Eventually, it seeks to create a web of economic relations with the PRC at its center, making it the most concrete geographical representation of the PRC’s global ambitions. BRI increases the economic influence of state-owned PRC firms in global markets, enhances the PRC’s political leverage with government leaders around the world, and provides greater access to strategic nodes such as ports and railways. Through BRI, the PRC seeks political deference through economic dependence.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HF390F00E541E49D0BD62C2C108BFEC35"><enum>(16)</enum><text>The PRC is executing a plan to establish regional hegemony over the Indo-Pacific and displace the United States from the region.
