Children are most vulnerable to the effects of pollution and can suffer lifelong consequences.

<paragraph id="H28643293A95A47A1917AA47124C3F0AD"><enum>(11)</enum><text>Cumulative impact assessments built into permitting decisions are one critical tool for preventing increased environmental and public health degradation in overburdened communities. At its most basic, cumulative impact assessment requires studying the impacts of having multiple pollution sources and stressors combined together on public health and the environment. While the effects of a single pollutant from a single source may be less significant when analyzed in isolation, the cumulative impacts of multiple pollutants from multiple sources in combination with each other and with other social vulnerabilities degrade public health and the environment substantially. Cumulative impact assessments should be incorporated into pollution permitting decisions such that Federal regulators are required to deny permits that threaten public health and the environment.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H53671F4B97514CEC869C689033527B43"><enum>(12)</enum><text>The general failure of the Federal Government to consider and regulate potential cumulative impacts in pollution permitting decisions has resulted in the inequitable distribution of pollution across regions and overburdening of certain communities.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H1AD0438E4A55494081A6416F66901E52"><enum>(13)</enum><text>Federal Government inaction has forced some State and local governments to act on their own to regulate cumulative impacts, including California and New Jersey, creating a patchwork of cumulative impact regulations across the country.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H870F2EFB2873461AB5C74430760C3C0C"><enum>(14)</enum><text>The Federal Government is aware of the importance of cumulative impact assessment in other types of environmental review, such as with environmental assessments conducted under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (<external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/42/4321">42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.</external-xref>).</text></paragraph>
