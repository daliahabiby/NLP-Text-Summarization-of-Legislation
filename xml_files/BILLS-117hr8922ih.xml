Many of these communities arrived as refugees beginning over 40 years ago from Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, in the aftermath of the wars in Southeast Asia (more commonly known as the <quote>Vietnam War</quote>).</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HF81E4E411EDF40E98C740F21B4A99AD9"><enum>(2)</enum><text>The United States intervened in Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam between 1954 and 1975, to prevent the spread of communism in Southeast Asia through direct military interventions and covert and clandestine operations.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H85DC5DE101EC48DBAD650FA34680D343"><enum>(3)</enum><text>South Vietnam allied with the United States in opposition to the expansion of North Vietnam until the Fall of Saigon on April 30, 1975. As a result of this service, many Vietnamese Americans to this day still suffer lasting trauma from the war, including post-traumatic stress disorder and exposure to Agent Orange. The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and various agencies enlisted over 30,000 soldiers from Hmong, Lao, and Laotian ethnic groups in Laos as allies to aid United States forces in Southeast Asia, waging a 13-year covert operation called the <quote>Secret War</quote> against the Pathet Lao, Viet Cong, and Northern Vietnamese Army.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H09522F7860A446DFAB5D735B7FC5BB24"><enum>(4)</enum><text>The United States heavily bombed Laos, making it the most heavily bombed country in the world, with over 580,000 bombing missions between 1964 and 1973. Today, an estimated 80,000,000 bombs remain unexploded, with 20,000 people who have been injured or killed since the bombings stopped.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H93CF842EE23A402B87CA9BD8FAB34A41"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Between 1969 to 1973, the United States dropped 540,000 tons of bombs into Cambodia against Viet Cong forces, destabilizing the country’s already fragile government. This mass bombing of Cambodia’s countryside helping to fuel the rise of the Khmer Rouge, which subsequently carried out the destruction of Cambodian society and the genocide of an estimated 2,000,000 Cambodians.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HEA7D60E8F8D34008831FD5F2024374F5"><enum>(6)</enum><text>Over 3,000,000 individuals were displaced by war, conflict, and genocide from Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos. Between 1975 to 2008, the United States Government resettled over 1,200,000 Southeast Asian refugees in this country, as part of the largest refugee resettlement effort in the history of the United States. Southeast Asian refugees included survivors of the war in Vietnam and Laos, the genocide in Cambodia, Hmong soldiers and their families who received refugee status in exchange for their service in the Secret War, and other ethnic minority groups persecuted in the aftermath of the war.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HA9398277B14C47D7A9A39509554093EE"><enum>(7)</enum><text>Many Southeast Asian refugees face significant physical and mental health issues, such as post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, stemming from their experiences escaping war, genocide, torture, and mass starvation. Additionally, many Southeast Asian refugees were resettled in communities that were heavily disinvested and lacked long-term resettlement support, causing many Southeast Asians also suffer from systemic poverty, discrimination, and linguistic barriers.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H6FC9BE4D5D8440F699D75D38EF41595A"><enum>(8)</enum><text>Immigrant communities face significant challenges assimilating as a result of the trauma of war.

First generation immigrants are especially vulnerable to gang violence within communities in which their parents cannot guide them with cultural or political familiarity.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HB2892FC10F2D413E8FC0BBBDE3739B5B"><enum>(9)</enum><text>Key policies during the 1990s including the period’s <quote>War on Drugs</quote>, passage of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, expansion of the carceral system, and over-policing of low-income communities of color entangled a significant number of Southeast Asian Americans, especially Southeast Asian youth, within the criminal justice system. During this period, Southeast Asian youth were incarcerated at twice the rate of White youth for similar offenses.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HE4681990FF9E4C1C9788E343560F0044"><enum>(10)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Additional immigration policies during the 1990s reinforced this emerging prison to deportation pipeline.

IIRIRA also applied these changes retroactively without proper consideration of an individual’s lived circumstances.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HD83FCB58E7224E41AA5753F862D8606D"><enum>(11)</enum><text>Approximately 15,000 long-term residents of Southeast Asian descent, many of whom initially arrived as child refugees, live in the United States with a final order of removal.
