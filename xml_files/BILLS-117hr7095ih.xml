Faithful execution of the law requires that the President have appropriate management oversight regarding this select cadre of professionals.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H570167380638477B88B3E646B9B4725F"><enum>(2)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The Federal Government benefits from career professionals in positions that are not normally subject to change as a result of a Presidential transition but who discharge significant duties and exercise significant discretion in formulating and implementing executive branch policy and programs under the laws of the United States. The heads of executive departments and agencies (agencies) and the American people also entrust these career professionals with non-public information that must be kept confidential.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HB1052D6B33044C64B1778A7741A0F8EC"><enum>(3)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">With the exception of attorneys in the Federal service who are appointed pursuant to schedule A of the excepted service and members of the Senior Executive Service, appointments to these positions are generally made through the competitive service. Given the importance of the functions they discharge, employees in such positions must display appropriate temperament, acumen, impartiality, and sound judgment. </text></paragraph><paragraph id="HF8445EDDAE574BB2B0F8C978B3F57F2B"><enum>(4)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Due to these requirements, agencies should have a greater degree of appointment flexibility with respect to these employees than is afforded by the existing competitive service process.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H795D054670B34C299E3EF2A7B0785278"><enum>(5)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Further, effective performance management of employees in confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating positions is of the utmost importance. Unfortunately, the Government’s current performance management is inadequate, as recognized by Federal workers themselves. For instance, the 2016 Merit Principles Survey reveals that less than a quarter of Federal employees believe their agency addresses poor performers effectively.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HEA501C41C9524043AE1C0849B26AC961"><enum>(6)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Separating employees who cannot or will not meet required performance standards is important, and it is particularly important with regard to employees in confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating positions. High performance by such employees can meaningfully enhance agency operations, while poor performance can significantly hinder them. Senior agency officials report that poor performance by career employees in policy-relevant positions has resulted in long delays and substandard-quality work for important agency projects, such as drafting and issuing regulations.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HE6F7C13C74A04C6E9A2113AEE8406B26"><enum>(7)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Conditions of good administration make necessary an exception to the competitive hiring rules and examinations for career positions in the Federal service of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character. These conditions include the need to provide agency heads with additional flexibility to assess prospective appointees without the limitations imposed by competitive service selection procedures. Placing these positions in the excepted service will mitigate undue limitations on their selection. This action will also give agencies greater ability and discretion to assess critical qualities in applicants to fill these positions, such as work ethic, judgment, and ability to meet the particular needs of the agency. These are all qualities individuals should have before wielding the authority inherent in their prospective positions, and agencies should be able to assess candidates without proceeding through complicated and elaborate competitive service processes or rating procedures that do not necessarily reflect their particular needs.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HB01A98D9032A4112ACD0648ACF3A8950"><enum>(8)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Conditions of good administration similarly make necessary excepting such positions from the adverse action procedures set forth in <external-xref legal-doc="usc-chapter" parsable-cite="usc-chapter/5/75">chapter 75</external-xref> of title 5, United States Code. <external-xref legal-doc="usc-chapter" parsable-cite="usc-chapter/5/75">Chapter 75</external-xref> of title 5, United States Code, requires agencies to comply with extensive procedures before taking adverse action against an employee. These requirements can make removing poorly performing employees difficult. Only a quarter of Federal supervisors are confident that they could remove a poor performer. Career employees in confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, and policy-advocating positions wield significant influence over Government operations and effectiveness. Agencies need the flexibility to expeditiously remove poorly performing employees from these positions without facing extensive delays or litigation.</text></paragraph></section><section id="H81B259114C5247599FA586B7560A4232"><enum>103.</enum><header>Schedule F of the excepted service</header><subsection id="H8C1D2226701D44D8BF36109202E2BD85"><enum>(a)</enum><header>In general</header><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Appointments of individuals to positions of a confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character that are not normally subject to change as a result of a Presidential transition shall be made under schedule F of the excepted service, as established by subsection (b).</text></subsection><subsection id="HE0F714C9ECD849508BC0432BF72A6B01"><enum>(b)</enum><header>Regulations</header><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The Director of the Office of Personnel Management shall—</text><paragraph id="H1114EA03DFDE419483B66AF0E26C5EB5"><enum>(1)</enum><text>amend section 6.2 of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, to read as follows:</text><quoted-block style="USC" id="H46F23549AD504A59AEC618DCBA91E049" display-inline="no-display-inline"><list list-type="none" level="section"><list-item>OPM shall list positions that it excepts from the competitive service in Schedules A, B, C, D, E, and F, which schedules shall constitute parts of this rule, as follows:</list-item><list-item>Schedule A.

The agency head shall take all practicable steps to render the determinations required by this subsection within 30 days of the date the agreement is executed, in accordance with section 7114(c) of title 5, United States Code, so as not to permit any part of an agreement to become effective that is contrary to applicable law, rule, or regulation.</text></subsection></section><section id="H1387A85050D8411AACC638EE763175B2"><enum>407.</enum><header>Permissive bargaining</header><text display-inline="no-display-inline">The heads of agencies subject to the provisions of <external-xref legal-doc="usc-chapter" parsable-cite="usc-chapter/5/71">chapter 71</external-xref> of title 5, United States Code, may not negotiate over the substance of the subjects set forth in section 7106(b)(1) of title 5, United States Code, and shall instruct subordinate officials that they may not negotiate over those same subjects.</text></section><section id="HBA6BE8D42DF047B5991F01A207656165"><enum>408.</enum><header>Efficient bargaining over procedures and appropriate arrangements</header><subsection id="HF5DB525DC38B4030A512E08A0CB59CF0"><enum>(a)</enum><header>Matters covered by existing agreements</header><text>Before beginning negotiations during a CBA over matters addressed by sections 7106(b)(2) or 7106(b)(3) of title 5, United States Code, agencies shall evaluate whether or not such matters are already covered by the CBA and therefore are not subject to the duty to bargain.
