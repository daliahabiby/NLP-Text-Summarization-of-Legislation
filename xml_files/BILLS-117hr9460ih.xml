Transnational repression is often used to silence individuals who oppose or are critical of a government, including journalists, human rights defenders, religious or ethnic minority groups, and political opponents. Methods of transnational repression are known to include physical and digital stalking, harassment, computer hacking, criminal threats, assaults, attempted kidnappings, coerced repatriation, and detaining family members in the home country.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H10303FE9637B422A88B995C04EB13020"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Transnational repression is not limited to physical acts of intimidation and harassment. According to Citizen Lab, <quote>digital transnational repression</quote> tools are used to facilitate government reach beyond borders to gain access to social media and email accounts, including through phishing attacks, zero-click spyware hacks, social media page takedowns, SIM card hacks, and fake invitations to conferences. For human rights activists and dissidents, this has a serious impact on their advocacy work and sense of security, even if they have relocated to escape physical intimidation.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HD6FD58B63E194226BCBBEC1088A7D07D"><enum>(4)</enum><text>On February 23, 2022, the National Security Division of the Department of Justice launched a <quote>Strategy for Countering Nation-State Threats</quote> in order to take a comprehensive, <quote>whole-of-government</quote> approach to addressing threats the United States faces from hostile nations, including transnational repression. </text></paragraph><paragraph id="H02142EC389ED408D92A88FB27D07B165"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Throughout 2022, the Department of Justice has charged a number of individuals with stalking, harassing, and spying, who allegedly perpetrated transnational repression to silence United States residents who were critics of the Peopleâ€™s Republic of China.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HAFF3F7F21944455888D1E21D9F876B86"><enum>(6)</enum><text>Transnational repression is a growing problem.

Four governments, Algeria, Belarus, Comoros, and Nigeria, attacked exiles abroad for the first time last year, bringing the total number of states engaged in transnational repression to 36. The number of host countries, or countries where acts of transnational repression took place, rose from 79 to 84, including the United States.</text></paragraph></section><section id="HFCBD9F0E7D0A452C861305358CC7B5D8"><enum>3.</enum><header>Sense of Congress</header><text display-inline="no-display-inline">It is the sense of Congress that hostile nations and authoritarian regimes have increasingly and aggressively targeted individuals in the United States. Agents of these governments have acted outside diplomatic channels to threaten, intimidate, harass, surveil, stalk, silence, and even plot to physically harm or kidnap persons within U.S. borders. Although transnational repression often involves actions that are already prohibited by U.S. law, their foreign government backing render these activities more egregious than the underlying acts of intimidation or harassment alone. Therefore, it is necessary to formally define and criminalize transnational repression in Federal law, and more actively track and report on instances transnational repression in the United States. </text></section><section id="H124B6B7505124F10A98AE40598DC6703"><enum>4.</enum><header>Criminalizing transnational repression</header><subsection id="HAF4441B0E9DB47B7868F460E40624762"><enum>(a)</enum><header>Offense</header><text display-inline="yes-display-inline"><external-xref legal-doc="usc-chapter" parsable-cite="usc-chapter/18/45">Chapter 45</external-xref> of title 18, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:</text><quoted-block style="USC" id="H7797223CE475463D93B85489858D49F8" display-inline="no-display-inline"><section id="H27FF7029AD5C49BFB340F16395640F2E"><enum>971.</enum><header>Transnational repression</header><subsection id="HE995858CDE634D779F3FCB2F8D3B1B17"><enum>(a)</enum><header>In general</header><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Whoever knowingly commits an act of transnational repression shall be fined under this title and imprisoned not more than 10 years.</text></subsection><subsection id="H9EE170250E3A43CA8F61039B494682FA"><enum>(b)</enum><header>Attempt or conspiracy</header><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Whoever attempts or conspires to commit an offense under this section shall be subject to the same penalties as those prescribed for the offense, the commission of which was the object of the attempt or conspiracy.</text></subsection><subsection id="H1C141B3D5CE7415F98347D460EF864E0" commented="no"><enum>(c)</enum><header>Extraterritorial Jurisdiction</header><text>There is extraterritorial Federal jurisdiction over an offense under this section.</text></subsection><subsection id="H926F10B46CD94DBC879D44AA1C9424D1"><enum>(d)</enum><header>Definitions</header><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">In this section:</text><paragraph id="H7FD65896BF0C4554897B0C4684A6FC78"><enum>(1)</enum><header>Agent of a foreign power</header><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The term <quote>agent of a foreign power</quote> means an individual who operates subject to the direction or control of a foreign government or official.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HB0599258D0BE44C29AD394CCAC474420"><enum>(2)</enum><header>Extrajudicial killing</header><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The term <quote>extrajudicial killing</quote> means an act with the intention to or in the knowledge that such act will end the life of another person, when that act is not incident to lawful sanction, public necessity, self-defense or the defense of others, or the law of armed conflict.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H40B3DF48BF6D4D4BA15C39F052522D43"><enum>(3)</enum><header>Proxy</header><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The term <quote>proxy</quote> means an individual acting on behalf of an agent of a foreign power.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HEE1B52AEB0E54852A849F179EEC9F6CE"><enum>(4)</enum><header>Transnational repression</header><text>The term <quote>transnational repression</quote> means any activity by a foreign government, or an agent of a foreign power or a proxy thereof, that meets each of the following criteria:</text><subparagraph id="HA3AA76EDA6BB46119941BB90B893A01C"><enum>(A)</enum><text>The activity involvesâ€”</text><clause id="H27F77FFB40C540FF925B696CC1E3465E"><enum>(i)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">any effort intended to intimidate or coerce, including by force or fear, a person to take an action in the interest of a foreign government;</text></clause><clause id="H8BB886C60C574140B218307CB8D7215B"><enum>(ii)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">any effort intended to intimidate or coerce, including by force or fear, a person to take an action to forebear from exercising a right guaranteed to the person by the Constitution or laws of the United States;</text></clause><clause id="H149528FFACF94FF1A4C8EB6A3B6375DC"><enum>(iii)</enum><text>enabling an effort specified in clause (i) or (ii);
