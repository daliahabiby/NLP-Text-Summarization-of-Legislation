According to a fair lending and credit risk analysis by Fannie Mae and the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the populations most likely to benefit from this change are applicants with lower credit scores, who are disproportionately consumers of color.</text></paragraph></section><section id="H68D25F3A14FA4FA88A637C4938C17D36"><enum>3.</enum><header>Requirement to consider additional credit information when making mortgage loans</header><subsection id="H8F533962F92D43328E7C372B2448116B"><enum>(a)</enum><header>In general</header><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (<external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/15/1691">15 U.S.C. 1691 et seq.</external-xref>) is amended by inserting after section 701 the following:</text><quoted-block style="USC" id="HAEF25C8ABA9148D19DC3CE5FFB52D274" display-inline="no-display-inline"><section id="H21EE511DA7534C6FAE75F961E7BAB200"><enum>701A.</enum><header>Requirement to consider additional credit information when making mortgage loans</header><subsection id="H56FC0CB8769D4C1B94F14C7E6B6CDC93"><enum>(a)</enum><header>In general</header><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">A creditor extending a mortgage loan shall, in evaluating the creditworthiness of an applicant, consider credit information not reported through a consumer reporting agency, if—</text><paragraph id="HB52BFBFC2C034E9FA072DB6489E333A3"><enum>(1)</enum><text>the applicant—</text><subparagraph id="H55BCD9939F7247EDAED42A114EB5BEF6"><enum>(A)</enum><text>requests such consideration;</text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="HA16EBDF6486F465EADFE68B41B20C2D8"><enum>(B)</enum><text>authorizes the provision of the credit information to be considered;
