To achieve optimum yields on a continuing basis while conserving and maintaining fisheries and integrating healthy ecosystem considerations, managers require reliable, timely data across all regions and fishing sectors for conservation, management, and scientific purposes. To achieve management goals especially in the context of climate change, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration should work to meet evolving management needs and, in collaboration with industry stakeholders, identify appropriate data collection technologies and strategies. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration should also consider the use of innovative technology in fishery independent data collection including stock and habitat assessments and environmental conditions.</text></subsection><subsection id="H7F49CE511BD34A15BA4AB51F7947D6AB"><enum>(b)</enum><header>Fishery Management Councils</header><text>Section 303(b)(8) (<external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/16/1853">16 U.S.C. 1853(b)(8)</external-xref>) is amended to read as follows:</text><quoted-block style="OLC" id="HB9782A16322445FFA2A044E2EF62BA2F" display-inline="no-display-inline" changed="added" reported-display-style="italic" committee-id="HII00"><paragraph id="H04600516F46443F6B2E1C64F8E7AA371"><enum>(8)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">require the collection of data necessary for the conservation and management of the fishery to be collected from a vessel of the United States engaged in fishing for species that are subject to the plan through—</text><subparagraph id="H74F49B9EBF8C4338A12FA9CE28B45F11"><enum>(A)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">electronic monitoring or other electronic technology; or</text></subparagraph><subparagraph id="HEAA532972C414E6EAFD856DCB9E2B4D9"><enum>(B)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">observers carried onboard such vessel, except that such a vessel shall not be required to carry an observer on board if the facilities of the vessel for the quartering of an observer, or for carrying out observer functions, are so inadequate or unsafe that the health or safety of the observer or the safe operation of the vessel would be jeopardized;</text></subparagraph></paragraph><after-quoted-block>.</after-quoted-block></quoted-block></subsection><subsection id="H58D7CE067F63483DBB32DF64EAEFE115"><enum>(c)</enum><header>Information systems</header><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Section 402(a) (<external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/16/1881a">16 U.S.C. 1881a(a)</external-xref>) is amended—</text><paragraph id="H62D29E5B0A844985A69A9E3FE23E3CEF"><enum>(1)</enum><text>in paragraph (1), by inserting <quote>The Council shall consider the use of electronic monitoring and reporting or other electronic technology as part of an information collection program under this subsection.</quote> after <quote>request.</quote>;</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HF683AF1032A74021B21058234B53BDA5"><enum>(2)</enum><text>in paragraph (2), by inserting <quote>The Secretary shall consider the use of electronic monitoring and reporting or other electronic technology as part of an information collection program.</quote> after <quote>fishery.</quote>; and</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H10DA914101894776A0620F57982D6AFC"><enum>(3)</enum><text>by adding at the end the following:</text><quoted-block style="OLC" id="H4874DE2BC5A94332A160C940F346BB21" display-inline="no-display-inline" changed="added" reported-display-style="italic" committee-id="HII00"><paragraph id="HD7B2484048A74C8B85A5986BE1E0B3FF"><enum>(3)</enum><header>Secretarial review</header><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Not less often than once every 5 years, the Secretary shall review the procedures and policies by which information is collected, managed, and used to manage fisheries and revise information collection programs and policies needed to integrate data collection and management, improve the timeliness, quality, usability, cost-effectiveness, and to reduce unnecessary duplication within and across fishery management plans and regions.
