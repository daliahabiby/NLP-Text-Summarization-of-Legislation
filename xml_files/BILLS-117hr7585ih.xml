The violent legacy of these systems of oppression has manifested in policies including enslavement, rape, and experimentation on Black people, forced sterilizations, medical experimentation on low-income people’s reproductive systems, and the forcible removal of Indigenous children. Access to equitable reproductive health care, including abortion services, has always been deficient in the United States for Black, Indigenous, and other People of Color (BIPOC) and their families. Transgender, nonbinary, and gender-expansive individuals, and specifically those who are Black, disabled, and at the intersections of multiple forms of oppression, also experience inequitable access to abortion services due to systemic violence. Centering abortion rights and access as a <quote>women’s health</quote> issue restricts access to those with reproductive needs who do not identify as cisgender women. In order to work towards reproductive justice for all communities, transgender, nonbinary, and gender expansive must be centered in conversations of abortion access. Improving abortion access for this community requires a gender-neutral approach to abortion care, rights, and justice policy.</text></paragraph>

Access to abortion services is obstructed across the United States in various ways, including blockades of health care facilities and associated violence, prohibitions of, and restrictions on, insurance coverage, parental involvement laws (notification and consent), restrictions that shame and stigmatize people seeking abortion services, and medically unnecessary regulations that neither confer any health benefit nor further the safety of abortion services, but which harm people by delaying, complicating access to, and reducing the availability of, abortion services. As of December 2, 2021, 19 States have enacted 106 restrictions, including 12 new abortion bans, making 2021 the year with the highest number of restrictions passed since Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973. Additionally, 21 States are poised to immediately ban or significantly restrict access to abortion services if the Supreme Court chooses to overturn or weaken Roe v. Wade. These unprecedented attacks on abortion rights and access fall especially heavily on people with low incomes, BIPOC, immigrants, young people, people with disabilities, those living in rural and other medically underserved areas, and transgender, nonbinary, and gender expansive individuals.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H9F2D43C797664B9BB8C3775D06A89B0C" commented="no"><enum>(5)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Since 1976, the Federal Government has withheld funds for abortion coverage in most circumstances through the Hyde amendment and similar coverage restrictions, affecting individuals of reproductive age in the United States who are insured through the Medicaid program, as well as individuals who receive insurance or care through other Federal health plans and programs. Of women aged 15 to 44 enrolled in Medicaid in 2017, 55 percent lived in the 35 States and the District of Columbia that do not cover abortion, except in limited circumstances. This amounts to roughly 7,300,000 women of reproductive age, including 3,100,000 women living below the Federal poverty level. Women of color are disproportionately likely to be insured by the Medicaid program, and nationwide, 32 percent of Black women and 27 percent of Hispanic women aged 15 to 44 were enrolled in Medicaid in 2017, compared with 16 percent of White women.</text></paragraph>

Early diagnosis, which is determined through simple blood tests, can reduce the risk of transmission and disease progression through education and vaccination of household members and other susceptible persons at risk.</text></paragraph>

While there is no cure for chronic HBV, available treatments can effectively suppress viral replication in the overwhelming majority of those treated, thereby reducing the risk of transmission and progression to liver scarring or liver cancer.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H3CA94BFFB7814179800170F973813B39"><enum>(12)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The annual health care costs attributable to HBV and HCV in the United States are significant. For HBV, it is estimated to be approximately $2,500,000,000 ($2,000 per infected person). In 2000, the lifetime cost of HBV, before the availability of most current therapies, was approximately $80,000 per chronically infected person, totaling more than $100,000,000,000. For HCV, medical costs for patients are expected to increase from $30,000,000,000 in 2009 to over $85,000,000,000 in 2024. Avoiding these costs by screening and diagnosing individuals earlier, and connecting them to appropriate treatment and care, will save lives and critical health care dollars. Currently, without a comprehensive screening, testing, and diagnosis program, most patients are diagnosed too late when they need a liver transplant costing at least $314,000 for uncomplicated cases or when they have liver cancer or end-stage liver disease which costs $30,980 to $110,576 per hospital admission. As health care costs continue to grow, it is critical that the Federal Government invests in effective mechanisms to avoid documented cost drivers. </text></paragraph>

<paragraph id="H666DDF1BCA86440E9109BBBBB8150F90"><enum>(1)</enum><text>At present, 32 States and 2 United States territories have criminal statutes based on perceived exposure to HIV, rather than behaviors motivated by an intent to harm, presenting a significant risk of transmission and resulting in actual transmission of HIV to another. 11 States have HIV-specific laws that make spitting or biting a felony, even though it is not possible to transmit HIV via saliva. 24 States require persons who are aware that they have HIV to disclose their status to sexual partners, regardless of whether they are noninfectious. 14 of these 24 States also require disclosure to needle-sharing partners. 25 States criminalize 1 or more behaviors that pose a low or negligible risk for HIV transmission.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H0A378FBF9B634B8BBC52C097F745227F"><enum>(2)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">HIV-specific criminal laws are classified as felonies in 28 States. In 3 States, a person’s exposure to another to HIV does not subject the person to criminal prosecution for that act alone but may result in a sentence enhancement. 18 States impose sentences of up to 10 years per violation, 7 States impose sentences between 11 and 20 years, and 5 States impose sentences of greater than 20 years.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HBBE8A805B35042C2AF58CFE313BEBFAA"><enum>(3)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">When members of the Armed Forces acquire HIV, they are issued orders that require them to disclose and use a condom under all circumstances including when the known risk of transmission is 0. Failure to disclose can result in prosecution under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ).</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H2C680F3E3C2E4F2B9E4A63D581B1AE5B"><enum>(4)</enum><text>The number of prosecutions, arrests, and instances where HIV-based charges are used to induce plea agreements is unknown. Because State-level prosecution and arrest data are not readily available in any national legal database, the societal impact of these laws may be underestimated and most cases that go to trial are not reduced to written, published opinions.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H2B206C07A6514783A1AF69E411FE16AB"><enum>(5)</enum><text>State and Federal criminal law does not currently reflect the 4 decades of medical advances and discoveries made with regard to transmission and treatment of HIV/AIDS.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H52A560D19F1E41929343F52C04D07076"><enum>(6)</enum><text>According to the CDC, correct and consistent male or female condom use, or adherence to a preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) regimen that results in viral suppression, are very effective in preventing HIV transmission. However, most State HIV-specific laws and prosecutions do not treat the use of a condom during sexual intercourse or adherence to PrEP as a mitigating factor or evidence that the defendant did not intend to transmit HIV.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H21621E0F409B48EB9F8354BA800414DF"><enum>(7)</enum><text>Criminal laws and prosecutions do not take into account the benefits of effective antiretroviral medications, which suppress the virus to extremely low levels and further reduce the already low risk of transmitting HIV to near 0.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HD0F86CC758C64D8B86A90E59E35F915B"><enum>(8)</enum><text>In addition to HIV-specific criminal laws, general criminal laws are often misused to prosecute people based on their HIV status. Although HIV, and even AIDS, currently is viewed as a treatable, chronic, medical condition, people living with HIV have been charged under aggravated assault, attempted murder, and even bioterrorism statutes because prosecutors, courts, and legislators continue to view and characterize the blood, semen, and saliva of people living with HIV as a <quote>deadly weapon</quote>.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HB1EA18BA581F4B9BBE550E40F1E34C7A"><enum>(9)</enum><text>Multiple peer-reviewed studies demonstrate that HIV-specific laws do not reduce risk-taking behavior or increase disclosure by people living with or at risk of HIV, and there is increasing evidence that these laws reduce the willingness to get tested. Furthermore, placing legal responsibility for preventing the transmission of HIV and other pathogens that can be sexually transmitted exclusively on people diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection undermines the public health message that all people are responsible for practicing behaviors that protect themselves from HIV and other sexually transmitted infections. Unfortunately, some State laws create an expectation of disclosure work against public health communication and discourage risk-reduction measures that could prevent transmission as a result of those who are acutely infected and unaware of their status.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H35104C9136884D1980FDD895EF45BF65"><enum>(10)</enum><text>The identity of an individual subject to an HIV-based prosecution is broadcast through media reports, potentially destroying employment opportunities and relationships and violating the person’s right to privacy.</text></paragraph>

Their employability is destroyed, and their family relationships are fractured.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H8B3A9DFC046D42C188E71643B01FFB46"><enum>(12)</enum><text>The United Nations, including the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), urges governments to <quote>limit criminalization to cases of intentional transmission</quote>. This requirement would limit prosecutions to situations <quote>where a person knows his or her HIV-positive status, acts with the intention to transmit HIV, and does in fact transmit it</quote>. UNAIDS also recommends that criminal law should not be applied to cases where there is no significant risk of transmission.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H44955D91C9A14369A9D0E6B6BC826A69"><enum>(13)</enum><text>In 2010, the Federal Government released the first ever National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS), which addressed HIV-specific criminal laws, stating: <quote>While we understand the intent behind these laws, they may not have the desired effect and they may make people less willing to disclose their status by making people feel at even greater risk of discrimination. In some cases, it may be appropriate for legislators to reconsider whether existing laws continue to further the public interest and public health. In many instances, the continued existence and enforcement of these types of laws run counter to scientific evidence about routes of HIV transmission and may undermine the public health goals of promoting HIV screening and treatment.</quote>. The NHAS also states that State legislatures should consider reviewing HIV-specific criminal statutes to ensure that they are consistent with current knowledge of HIV transmission and support public health approaches to preventing and treating HIV.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H144F33AD636040B7844064815AEE7231"><enum>(14)</enum><text>The Global Commission on HIV and the Law was launched in June 2010 to examine laws and practices that criminalize people living with and vulnerable to HIV and to develop evidence-based recommendations for effective HIV responses. The Commission calls for <quote>governments, civil society and international bodies to repeal punitive laws and enact laws that facilitate and enable effective responses to HIV prevention, care and treatment services for all who need them</quote>. The Commission recommends against the enactment of <quote>laws that explicitly criminalize HIV transmission, exposure or non-disclosure of HIV status, which are counterproductive</quote>.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HFC3C30D3C5154759B6B6767B6B702D5A"><enum>(15)</enum><text>In February 2019, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) launched <quote>Ending the HIV Epidemic: A Plan for America</quote>, a new initiative with an ambitious goal to end the domestic HIV epidemic in 10 years by reducing new cases of HIV by 75 percent by 2025 and by 90 percent by 2030. In this plan, HHS notes that stigma <quote>can be a debilitating barrier preventing people living with, or at risk for, HIV from receiving the health care, services, and respect they need and deserve</quote>. Many of the States and jurisdictions identified as a priority for the first 5 years of the plan have stigma-based criminal statutes for perceived exposure to HIV. These statutes run counter to the goals of this new initiative and stand in the way of ending the domestic HIV epidemic.</text></paragraph></subsection> <subsection id="H6A700736E15D43E3BA272DA3619D83E3"><enum>(b)</enum><header>Sense of Congress regarding laws or regulations directed at people living with HIV</header><text>It is the sense of Congress that Federal and State laws, policies, and regulations regarding people living with HIV—</text>

Income, education, occupation, neighborhood conditions, schools, workplaces, the use of health and social services, and experiences with the criminal justice system are all highly patterned by race, with people of color experiencing more that is health harming. Finding ways to uncouple the link between race and access to resources and healthy environments is a principal means of reducing health inequities. Additionally, the anticipation of racism itself causes higher psychological and cardiovascular stress levels that are linked to poor health outcomes. Remedying discriminatory practices at the individual and systemic levels will likely reduce health inequities caused by this unequal distribution of stress.</text></clause> <clause commented="no" id="HF530DD0648DC4148836C21D055E802D2"><enum>(iv)</enum><text>Poor health among Native Americans has largely been driven by post-colonial oppression and historical trauma.

Today, Native Americans have twice the rate of diabetes of non-Hispanic Whites. Recognition of the origins of diabetes as having a social and community context, rather than just individual responsibility and genetic predisposition, will shape better policy to provide food security.</text></clause>

In particular, the mass incarceration of African-American males as a result of inequities within and treatment in the criminal justice system has contributed to an overburdening of certain infectious diseases within the African-American community.

These experiences culminate in worse adult health as compared with children with higher socioeconomic status.
