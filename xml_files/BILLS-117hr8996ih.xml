<paragraph id="HB042797880044D628318AC70266AB0BC"><enum>(5)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The House has already recognized the national security issues inherent in undue foreign influence of entities with covert sources of foreign funding who testify before Congress. Since 2015, individuals who testify before the U.S. House of Representatives have been required to disclose relevant foreign funding sources directed to them or their employers in Truth in Testimony disclosure forms. (The original looser requirement was enacted in 1997.)</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H5423E3BFB9B041B985A3F93494BAAE83"><enum>(6)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Over 30 years ago, Congress enacted section 117 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) in light of concerns about the growing financial relationship between U.S. universities and foreign sources. Congress balanced academic freedom and national security by mandating financial transparency through required reporting of contracts with and gifts from a foreign source.</text></paragraph>
<paragraph id="H7A15B1C7609E4210AF099F2F3B632E3B"><enum>(7)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Section 117 does not prohibit institutions from taking foreign money; it mandates accurate and transparent disclosures of sources and amounts to the Department of Education. In 2019, the Department took concrete steps to enforce section 117 by ensuring the integrity of reporting requirements, confirming the correct reporting and categorization of donations, and prohibiting the use of domestic conduits and intermediaries to avoid the disclosures of foreign gifts.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HD6BED03DFC50455FB1E7DE1F5168129B"><enum>(8)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Between 2011 and 2021, Russia has given at least $160 million to U.S. universities. China alone has given at least $2.7 billion during the same time frame. And during that span, the State of Qatar has given at least $5 billion to U.S. universities.</text></paragraph>

<paragraph id="H8E33EE9F80304238BBFB8ED95AA8F4B4"><enum>(15)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The Stimson Center worked to significantly alter the Homeland and Cyber Threat Act (H.R. 1607, introduced into the 117th Congress on March 8, 2021). The HACT Act, which would provide an exception to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA) to allow U.S. persons harmed by foreign-government sponsored cyberattacks to bring civil claims for damages, passed in the last Congress with broad bipartisan support. The changes advocated by the Stimson Center would gut the bill and render it completely ineffective in holding foreign nations and their agents responsible for cyberattacks on and in the United States.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H0062045C144F444F988D1433FF1036E4"><enum>(16)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">One of the main sources of the Stimson Center’s funding is the State of Qatar, a major sponsor of terrorism worldwide and one of the most notorious sponsors of cyberattacks against U.S. entities. In 2019 alone (the last year public figures are available) the Stimson Center took over $600,000 in contributions from the Government of Qatar.</text></paragraph>
<paragraph id="H6B0DA87807214EA8AE0FAC4510EB440E"><enum>(17)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The Brookings Institution has received at least $22 million from the State of Qatar from 2013 through 2021, but the exact amount has not been disclosed publicly.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H065B7CE441214B00ACEA237A9FBBA1DA"><enum>(18)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">There is also significant concern in Congress about potential contractual stipulations tied to foreign funding that could be leveraged by foreign powers to exert even greater influence over the research and policy recommendations of think tanks that the Federal Government and the American public would otherwise believe to be independent.</text></paragraph>
<paragraph id="H2FADB44453DE407DB6A25445A6B706B3"><enum>(19)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">In a 2007 “Establishment Agreement” between the Brookings Institution and Qatar’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs—which appears to have been in place in its original form through the end of 2021—the Doha “branch” of the Brookings Institution, called Brookings Doha Center, was effectively owned and controlled by the Emir of Qatar. Under the terms of the contract, the Brookings Institution’s role in the Doha Center was limited to that of a “Promoter”.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HA1325C4B5FE84445B7B66504183BEB52"><enum>(20)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">As only revealed publicly in June 2022, the Brookings Doha Center was a separate and distinct legal entity, specifically a Private Foundation for the Public Benefit, the same incorporation status as the State of Qatar’s propaganda arm, Al Jazeera.</text></paragraph>
<paragraph id="H3F6D14963D014755B1993059F3B65845"><enum>(21)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Pursuant to the 2007 Establishment Agreement, the Director of the Brookings Doha Center was required to report directly to Qatar’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, including to “engage in regular consultation … regarding the development and ongoing operations” and for prior approval of “programs that will be developed by the [Brookings Doha] Center”.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H017063A2502C492F85C56DC0455C3BDE"><enum>(22)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The Brookings Doha Center was renamed the Middle East Council on Global Affairs, and evidence indicates that it is now entirely under the control of the Qatari Government. According to a January 2022 “Amendment” to the 2007 Articles of Incorporation, the Brookings Institution ceded the “Promoter” role for Brookings Doha Center to a senior employee of Qatar’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Majed Al-Ansari. This Amendment also called on the Middle East Council to assume control of intellectual property rights that had been under the “Brookings” brand, including the content from and followers of the “@BrookingsDoha” Twitter account.</text></paragraph>
<paragraph id="H1E939313CA934F66A97FED29271742AF"><enum>(23)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Congress currently is unable to determine what other agreements that the Brookings Institution or other influential think tanks have with foreign governmental entities, a void which has already been exploited by at least the State of Qatar in obtaining prior approval of budgets and research projects conducted under the branding of the Brookings Institution and the Brookings Doha Center in the aforementioned 2007 contract, or the transference of valuable intellectual property to the Qatari Government pursuant to the 2022 amendment.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H071A3AAB98944950B5E7985AB88FAAE4"><enum>(24)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">There is broad bipartisan agreement that undue foreign influence obscured through the use of proxies—or hidden by the powerful brand of a highly respected think tank—threatens the national security interests of the United States. There is also broad agreement that transparency is the most important and effective tool for reducing the harm of foreign influence targeting U.S. public policy or public opinion.</text></paragraph>
