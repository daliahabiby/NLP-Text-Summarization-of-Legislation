Residents purchase a below market-rate <quote>equity</quote> share of the cooperative corporation that owns the property of the cooperative and residents are charged affordable monthly carrying charges. The amount the share price increases over time is limited by the cooperative by-laws, creating an affordable entry point into housing that stays affordable over time. Members can sell their equity share at a specific rate to maintain affordability over a longer time period. In this way, limited equity cooperatives provide an important form of affordable homeownership and foster community among shareholders.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H846C928736AA4AE5B6B7DE78BC43AC8B"><enum>(2)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Over 1.5 million families and seniors benefit from cooperative housing models in the United States.
