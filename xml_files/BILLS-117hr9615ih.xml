At the high school level, athletic participation opportunities have increased from nearly 300,000 in 1972 to more than 3,400,000 in 2019. At the collegiate level, opportunities have increased from nearly 30,000 in 1972 to 215,000 in 2020 on teams sponsored by institutions who are members of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (referred to in this section as the <quote>NCAA</quote>).</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H1EA548C14423456483891BE39D7B8A4E"><enum>(3)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Despite progress, women and girls still face unequal opportunities. At the high school level, girls have over 1,000,000 fewer athletic opportunities than boys, with schools providing girls with 43 percent of all athletic opportunities while girls represent nearly half of all students. At the collegiate level, colleges would need to provide women with an additional 148,000 sports opportunities to match the same ratio of sports opportunities per student as is offered to men.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HC318AEADEA8740EAA737D9880BF2EC51"><enum>(4)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Girls of color are often most impacted by inequitable opportunities. At high schools predominantly attended by White students, girls have 82 percent of the opportunities that boys have to play sports, while at high schools predominantly attended by students of color, girls have only 67 percent of the opportunities that boys have to play sports.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HF743D1A5BDE84386B7F947AAD7B23E82"><enum>(5)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The magnitude of current gaps in intercollegiate participation opportunities is likely undercounted, as investigations of intercollegiate athletics data have found that the majority of NCAA member institutions inflate the number of women participating in sports by double- and triple-counting women athletes who participate in more than one sport more often than the institutions double- and triple-count their male counterparts, counting male practice players on women’s teams as women athletes, and packing women’s teams with extra players who never end up competing.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H2AB56EB74D8D43EF8D5177957634E941"><enum>(6)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Women and girls in sports also face unequal treatment. They are frequently provided worse facilities, equipment, and uniforms than men and boys, and they receive less financial support and publicity from their schools, as women receive $240,000,000 less than men in athletic-based scholarships annually. For every dollar colleges spend on recruiting, travel, and equipment for men’s sports, they spend 58 cents, 62 cents, and 73 cents, respectively, for women’s sports.</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HF4B9BCA6496C4E78A1E0644E4E27BC9C"><enum>(7)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Amid ongoing inequitable treatment, athletes and athletics-related staff too often are unaware of the rights and obligations that are described in or come from title IX. In surveys of children and their parents, the majority report not knowing what title IX is. A study conducted by the Government Accountability Office in 2017 found that the majority of high school athletic administrators were unaware of who their title IX coordinator was or felt unsupported by their title IX coordinator. In collegiate sports, the majority of coaches report that they never received formal training about title IX as part of the preparation for their jobs.</text></paragraph></section><section id="H066944B0C43A40519802376E5EE9CB4A"><enum>3.</enum><header>Purposes</header><text display-inline="no-display-inline">The purposes of this Act are to—</text><paragraph id="HFDA6A0CE3EFC46E8926234AB4DF9AE9B"><enum>(1)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">address inequitable and discriminatory treatment of women and girls in sports in elementary and secondary schools, as well as institutions of higher education; and</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H93E7E96288354FB187CEB42677E74B77"><enum>(2)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">improve the collection and transparency of data pertaining to participation in and support for women’s and girls’ sports at schools receiving Federal financial assistance. </text></paragraph></section><section id="H3B92AFDFB7A94BF69051489525299DAB"><enum>4.</enum><header>Discrimination by intercollegiate athletic associations</header><subsection id="HBF13871B78E542A2880907908D7FF491"><enum>(a)</enum><header>In general</header><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">No intercollegiate athletic association shall, on the basis of sex, subject any athlete to discrimination with respect to intercollegiate athletics, including discrimination through—</text><paragraph id="HD1D1535A0ACF445BBE8D8B586D09B37F"><enum>(1)</enum><text>the rules it sets for intercollegiate athletics;</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H5C761A180B2B446899846EFFD707E20A"><enum>(2)</enum><text>the sports required for association membership or the sports sponsored for association competitions or supported with association championships;</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HE246EA04B8E347D282C844CD996024BC"><enum>(3)</enum><text>the location, facilities, or amenities provided for association competitions or championships;</text></paragraph><paragraph id="HA6AEEE3DC905424DA5CA1EA72F31A646"><enum>(4)</enum><text>the provision or arrangement for the provision of goods or services (including benefits) for association competitions or championships; or</text></paragraph><paragraph id="H97AF1CD49A114BB6B9BCCA45C33911A6"><enum>(5)</enum><text>the distribution of revenues or other benefits to association members or institutions under the authority of the association.</text></paragraph></subsection><subsection id="H2CB8FA28F7254B0C9E70D706A64D0715"><enum>(b)</enum><header>Private right of action</header><text>A covered institution of higher education that is a member of or under the authority of an intercollegiate athletic association, or an individual who applies to participate, participates, or previously participated in intercollegiate athletics, at a covered institution of higher education that is a member of or under the authority of an intercollegiate athletic association, may bring an action in any Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction against the intercollegiate athletic association to remedy a violation of this section.
