Corporation, jointly, and after consultation with a balanced group of participant and employer representatives, shall with respect to plans referenced in subsection (a) report on the effectiveness of the applicable reporting and disclosure requirements and make such recommendations as may be appropriate to the appropriate committees of the Congress to consolidate, simplify, standardize, and improve such requirements so as to simplify reporting for such plans and ensure that plans can simply furnish and participants and beneficiaries timely receive and better understand the information they need to monitor their plans, plan for retirement, and obtain the benefits they have earned. Such report shall assess the extent to which retirement plans are retaining disclosures, work records, and plan documents that are needed to ensure accurate calculation of future benefits. To assess the effectiveness of the applicable reporting and disclosure requirements, the report shall include an analysis, based on plan data, of how participants and beneficiaries are providing preferred contact information, the methods by which plan sponsors and plans are furnishing disclosures, and the rate at which participants and beneficiaries (grouped by key demographics) are receiving, accessing, and retaining disclosures. The agencies shall conduct appropriate surveys and data collection to obtain any needed information. </text></subsection></section><section
