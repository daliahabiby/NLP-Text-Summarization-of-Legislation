# NLP-Text-Summarization-of-Legislation
This project aims to address the issue of accessibility concerning Congressional legislation. Using a selection of House Resolutions from the 117th Congress Second Session, we conducted a text summarization task through an extractive approach. We employed a pre-trained summarizer pipeline called LexRank from ‘sumy’ in python to generate summaries of 0.3 times the size of the bill. The success of this summary generation was evaluated through comparing readability scores and the cosine similarity of the bill text and their summaries. This evaluation revealed that LexRank failed to summarize many of the bills, and only generated shorter summaries for 22 bills. The readability scores of these summaries were similar to those of the original bills, but slightly higher on average. The average cosine similarity between these bills and summaries was moderate to weak. This study concluded that LexRank is a poor summarizing method for Congressional texts.
